prompts to find 4 markers that all give information about the course

they are then "collected" and the info is stored in the app

maybe have a little interactive character?? -- plane tracking is wank so i prob cant use that to place a char in the world

character pops up on top of markers -- otherwise is docked to screen

maybe tutorial - might be hard

TODO:
scene setup
collectable badges -- persistent
character on screen
character in world -- need provision for horiz and vertical markers
char does a lil animation to transfer between
cute lil sounds
haptic feedback
tutorial??



NUTODO:
Add badges - save to persist between app reload
character functionality:
	- talking to player (maybe have a dummy characterController that performs actions for character - control it through other script)
																																- going to markers (make sure speech bubbles scale correctly)
																																- animation to transition between camera and world
